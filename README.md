# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

In this module, I created visualizations of rideshare data for a company named PyBer (Which I believe is a portmanteau of 'Python' and 'Uber'). This was done with the purpose of helping improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

I was supplied ride share data from PyBer from January to May 2019, the data was comprehensive and consisted of fares, city, ride id, the amount of rides, driver count, and type of locale (differentiated between rural, suburban, and urban).

Challenge: V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

If we compare the average number of rides between each city type, we'll notice that the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4 and 3.5 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively.

There is one outlier in the urban ride count data. Also, the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4- and 3.5-times lower per city than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

From the combined box-and-whisker plots, we see that there are no outliers. However, the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

The average number of drivers in rural cities is nine to four times less per city than in urban and suburban cities, respectively. By looking at the driver count data and fare data, can you get a sense of the overall revenue?

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
